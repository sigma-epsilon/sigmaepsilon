# **SigmaEpsilon** - An Ecosystem of Python Libraries for Computational Engineering

[![Documentation](https://github.com/sigma-epsilon/sigmaepsilon/actions/workflows/page.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sigma-epsilon/sigmaepsilon/actions/workflows/page.yaml)

SigmaEpsilon is a collection of interrelated libraries to create an ecosystem of tools that make computational engineering more accessible and to provide the necessary technical background for meaningful research in the topic.

## Modules

The SigmaEpsilon namespace is an ecosystem of tools, consisting of the following sub-namespaces:

- **sigmaepsilon.core** - common developer utilities for all projects in the ecosystem
- **sigmaepsilon.math** - mathematical solutions to all kinds of problems, mainly centered around linear algebra and optimization
- **sigmaepsilon.mesh** - a module to handle polygonal meshes
- **sigmaepsilon.solid** - for numerical simulations in the field of computational solid mechanics

Each of these packages comes with their own documentation, where you can find all information on installation, usage, etc.

## Acknowledgements

Each module of the namespace comes with a set of dependencies, but almost all of them heavily relies on the cornerstones of scientific computing libraries such as `NumPy` and `SciPy`, etc.

These packages are usually funded by organizations such as NumFocus or Quansight. If your work relies on any of the solutions provided by the SigmaEpsilon ecosystem, please visit their documentation and consider donating to their supporting organizations to help maintaining the long term sustainability of these projects.

Also, funding of these libraries is partly based on the size of the community they are able to support. If what you are doing strongly relies on these libraries, don't forget to press the :star: button to show your support.

## Citing

Most of the open source scientific libraries this project relies on have a citable article. If your work relies on any of the solutions provided by the SigmaEpsilon ecosystem, please visit their documentation and cite their papers in your work.

## Background

The project started off as a need for organizing my code during my PhD studies, and later I (the author) decided to develop it into a system of namespace packages, to accelerate research in the field of Topology Optimization. Hence, the solutions within the modules of the SigmaEpsilon namespace are mainly centered around solid mechanics and optimization.

## License

While most libraries in the SigmaEpsilon ecosystem are distributed under the MIT license, some modules may have their own specific licensing terms. Please refer to the respective documentation for detailed information.
