This is the general documentation for the **SigmaEpsilon** ecosystem of Python libraries for computational 
engineering. The ecosystem is composed of the following libraries:

- sigmaepsilon.core
- sigmaepsilon.math
- sigmaepsilon.mesh
- sigmaepsilon.solid.fem
- sigmaepsilon.solid.material
- sigmaepsilon.solid.fourier

Each of these libraries come with their own documentation, which can be accessed by clicking on the links above.

In this documentation, we provide an overview of the ecosystem as a whole, and how the different libraries interact 
with each other. Moreover, this is where we collect all the general information about the ecosystem, such as the
installation instructions, and a detailed contributor's guide.
