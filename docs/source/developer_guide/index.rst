The Developer Guide is a collection of documents that provide detailed information on how to contribute to the
development of the SigmaEpsilon ecosystem. Since all the libraries in the ecosystem follow the same development
guidelines, this guide is common to all of them, while library-specific information is provided in the respective
library documentation.

Where to start
==============

It is somewhat obvious that if you want to contribute to the development of the SigmaEpsilon ecosystem, you should
have a good understanding of the Python programming language and you should also posess domain specific knowledge in
computational engineering. If you have these prerequisites, you can start by reading the :doc:`dev.overview` of the
steps involved in contributing to the ecosystem.
