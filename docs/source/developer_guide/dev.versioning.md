# Versioning

This module follows [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) principles.

Semantic Versioning is a versioning scheme for software that aims to convey
meaning about the underlying changes with each new release. The version number
is composed of three segments: MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH, formatted as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

- MAJOR version increments indicate incompatible API changes.
- MINOR version increments indicate backward-compatible functionality enhancements.
- PATCH version increments indicate backward-compatible bug fixes.

For example, version 2.1.3 would indicate:

- MAJOR version 2: There have been significant changes that may not be compatible with previous versions.
- MINOR version 1: New features have been added in a backward-compatible manner.
- PATCH version 3: Bug fixes have been made in a backward-compatible manner.

Adhering to Semantic Versioning helps users understand the impact of updating to a new version and ensures a more predictable development and release process.
