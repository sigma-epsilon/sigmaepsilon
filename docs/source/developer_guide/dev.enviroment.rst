======================
Development Enviroment
======================

You can pick any text editor or IDE of your choice to write code. However, we recommend using 
`Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ as it is lightweight, fast, and has a lot 
of features that make coding easier. Moreover, this is what most of the contributors use, so you
will be able to get help more easily. If you prefer a different editor, that's fine too and for
instance `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_ is a good alternative, but you might have
to figure out some things on your own.

.. note::
   If you are using something else than Visual Studio Code, you should still follow the instructions
   for setting up the virtual environment and installing the dependencies. For instance, we use an
   extension in Visual Studio Code that automatically formats the code according to the Black code
   style. If you are using another editor, you should install a similar extension for that editor
   or run the Black formatter manually.

Setting up Visual Studio Code
=============================

Installing Visual Studio Code
-----------------------------

The first step is obviously to install Visual Studio Code. You can download it from the
`official website <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ and follow the installation instructions.

Setting up extensions
---------------------

Essential extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have installed Visual Studio Code, you should install the following extensions:

- `Python <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`_
   For obvious reasons.

- `Python Environment Manager <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python-environment-manager>`_
   This extension will help you manage the Python environment in Visual Studio Code.

- `Black Formatter <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter>`_
   This extension will automatically format your code according to the Black code style.
   
Optional extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `GitHub Theme <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme>`_
   This extension will give you the GitHub theme for Visual Studio Code.

Color theme and syntax highlighting
------------------------------------

You can choose the color theme and syntax highlighting that you like. We recommend using the `GitHub Dark`
theme from the `GitHub Theme <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme>`_
extension.
