# Testing, Quality Control and Coverage Analysis

In this section, we will cover the testing strategies, quality control measures, and coverage analysis techniques used in the development of the `sigmaepsilon` library. Ensuring that our code is thoroughly tested and meets high-quality standards is crucial for maintaining the reliability and robustness of the library. We will discuss how to run tests, generate coverage reports, and utilize tools like Codacy for continuous quality control.

## Run Tests and Save the Coverage Report

To run tests and generate a coverage report for the library ``sigmaepsilon.solid.fourier``, use the following command:

```shell
poetry run pytest --cov-report=xml:coverage.xml --cov-config=.coveragerc --cov=sigmaepsilon.solid.fourier
```

## Codacy for Quality Control

We use Codacy for continuous quality control and code analysis. Codacy helps us maintain high code quality by providing automated code reviews, identifying potential issues, and suggesting improvements. It integrates seamlessly with our repository and provides insights into code coverage, code duplication, complexity, and adherence to coding standards.

To set up Codacy for your project, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) with your GitHub account.
2. Add your repository to Codacy.
3. Configure the analysis settings according to your project's needs.
4. Monitor the quality reports and address any issues highlighted by Codacy.

By using Codacy, we ensure that our codebase remains clean, maintainable, and of high quality.
